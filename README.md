# Foundit - A Smarter Way to Reunite Lost and Found Items

Foundit is an Android application that leverages modern technology to streamline the process of reuniting people with their lost belongings. Unlike traditional lost and found apps where users post items and hope someone finds them, Foundit uses a unique matching system to connect users who have lost items with those who have found similar items.

## Here's how it works:

- **Report Lost or Found Items**: Users simply enter details about the item they've lost or found, including a description and optionally a picture.

- **Advanced Matching Algorithm**: Foundit's powerful matching algorithm goes beyond just text descriptions. It considers multiple factors to improve the accuracy of matches, including:

  - **Textual Matching**: The algorithm searches for matches based on keywords and phrases in the descriptions provided by both users.

  - **Location Data (Optional)**: If users choose to share their location data, the app can factor in proximity when making matches.

   - **Image Recognition (Optional)**: Foundit can use image recognition technology to find matches between photos uploaded by users who have lost items and those who have found items.

- **Direct Communication**:  When a potential match is identified, Foundit anonymously notifies both users, allowing them to initiate a direct chat to arrange the return of the lost item.


## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: For Android app development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: For building the user interface.
- **Firebase**: 
  - **Firebase Realtime Database**: For storing real-time data on lost and found items.
  - **Firebase Cloud Storage**: For secure storage of user-uploaded pictures.
  - **Firebase Authentication** (optional): For user account management.
